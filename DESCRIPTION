Description: hmdR package comes alongwith preprocessed "hmd_pop" dataset.
    The Human Mortality Database (HMD) was developed to provide detailed population data for analysis
    to understand the history of human longevity.
    Further, we have collection of functions and layers to enhance 'ggplot2'. The main
    function is gghmd_yr(), which can be used to add faceted country plots
    to 'ggplot2' scatterplots. Similar to the above function, gghmd_loc() which can be used to
    plot seperate country plot with user defined timeframes.
